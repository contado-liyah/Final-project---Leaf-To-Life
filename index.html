                 Herbal teas, or infusions made from various
                plant parts, have ancient origins rooted in
                medicinal and cultural traditions across
                multiple civilizations. Unlike true tea, which
                comes from the Camellia sinensis plant,
                herbal teas are made from edible flowers,
                fruits, roots, and leaves. It is also rooted in
                China where they were first used for their
                medicinal properties, a practice that spread
                through ancient Egypt, Greece, and later to
                the rest of the world. The earliest
                documented evidence comes from the Tang
                Dynasty in China around 720 AD, as well as
                ancient Egyptian records of peppermint
                leaves. These infusions were valued not
                only for physical healing but also for
                spiritual and mental well-being before
                becoming popular for enjoyment and
                health benefits in modern times.

                According to legend, the practice of
            drinking herbal infusions began in
            ancient China with Emperor Shen Nong,
            who discovered tea when leaves fell into
            his boiling water around 2737 BCE. The
            earliest historical records and treatises,
            such as "Medical Secrets of an Official"
            by Wang Tao (720 AD), describe herbal
            teas for their healing properties. Today,
            herbal teas are consumed globally for
            their taste, aroma, and potential health
            benefits, ranging from physical wellness
            to mental clarity and spiritual awareness.
